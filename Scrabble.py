Scrabble Project Outline
----------------------

What we did:

-Ask player: Scrabble is a 2-4 player game so when you input 1 then we should repeat the question until they give us 2-4!

What we need to do:

-Draw for first play. The player with the letter closest to "A" plays first. A blank tile beats any letter. Return the letters to the pool and remix.
    -All players draw seven new letters and place them on their racks.
    -If two players tie for first, repeat
-Add function that allows the user to pull up the rules.txt file when needed
-Merriam-Webster's Official ScrabbleÂ® Players Dictionary, Fourth Edition (OSPD4) Thats the dictionary scrabble uses
