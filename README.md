##### Project Description: 
###### For our project, we made a scrabble game from scratch. By following the some of the rules of Scrabble, we implemented functions and methods to make a somewhat accurate representation of the game.
###### The use of dictionaries and lists will be used as the storing and calling of data such as strings and integers will be called frequently.
###### As for using an external library, we will probably use the PyEnchant to check if the word exists in the english dictionary. 
###### We used

# Disclaimer:
###### Due to time restraint and complexity of the scrabble game, Leman and I were able to finish roughly 80% of the game. Thus we transformed it into our own free style version of the game, where the constraint of the domino-like prerequisite to tile placing does not exist. And to make the game more fair when ending, we did not implement the usage of adding 50 points if the player finishes with no tiles in their hand. This is because PyEnchant accepts. single letter characters as words.
